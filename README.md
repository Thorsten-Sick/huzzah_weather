# Huzzah for weather forecast and a bit of IoT glamour

## Important: State

This project is currently in beta state. I will focus on another project now
and come back to this project later - till then I will test it in real-world
and collect bugs and improvement ideas.

One thing that bothers me is that the installed MQTT does not support HTTPS.
This is why I am just doing basic and local MQTT right now without password.

Be aware if you should copy & paste this code: No security available for
the ESP MQTT right now !
